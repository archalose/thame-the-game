# thame-the-game
 funny little game I made for my friend using the ever so frustrating pygame.
 
 - There are probably bugs.
 - As I said in my profile README, I am quite a beginner so I am aware of the redundance of some code and some bad pratices within the classes and objects.
 - Also a lot of code is repeated here, especially the dialogue section, I probably should have used a function but oh well too late now.
